Welcome!

OS Used : Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
Testfile provided : TESTFILE.txt (all functions are tested).
                    Accompanying scripts (script1, script2) are provided.
Compile script : ./compile.sh will create executable named mykernel

Notes/Assumptions: 
1. Invalid "exec" commands by user will terminate program execution
but will not terminate the shell itself. 
2. Instructions are read line-by-line, 
Please make sure accompanying scripts follow format. 
3. Shell memory is SHARED between all processes. 
Scripts WILL interfere with each other as they run because of this.
